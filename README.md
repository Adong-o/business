## How to View the Website

To view the website locally, you can use a simple local server. If you have Python installed, you can run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
# For Python 3
python -m http.server
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

Alternatively, you can use any other local server tool, such as the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code.
